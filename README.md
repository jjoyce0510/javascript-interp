# javascript_interpreter
A simple JavaScript interpreter for a final project in Fundamentals of Computing 2

Some current language restrictions:
    - All lines end with a semi colon;
    - All variables must be defined with var

This interpreter currently supports if-else, iterative for loops, while loops, variables, variable arithmetic, string concatenation, and more.  

TODO: Add functions, support multi-line bodies in control structures.
